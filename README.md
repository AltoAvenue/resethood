# The Sims 2 Neighborhood Reset Utility

As I was disappointed there is no utility to easily to reset neighborhoods on the Windows version of the Sims 2 Ultimate Collection (like there is for the Super Collection on Mac), I decided to create a simple one myself in batch.

This script assumes your game is installed to the default directory of `C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection`. It also assumes you have removed the trademark symbol from the game save's folder. If not, I have included a reg file (`resethood-notrademark.reg`) to do that as well. If you already have an existing save folder with the trademark symbol, be sure to remove it or else the game will generate a new one. Aside from allowing this script to work correctly, it also has the added benefit of mitigating some locale/encoding issues.
