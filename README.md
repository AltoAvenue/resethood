As I was disappointed there is no utility to easily to reset neighborhoods on the Windows version of the Sims 2 Ultimate Collection (like there is for the Super Collection on Mac), I decided to create a simple one myself in batch.

This script assumes your game is installed to the default directory of C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection. It also assumes you have removed the trademark symbol from the game save's folder. If not, I have included a reg file to do that as well.
